# Recipe App

## Overview
The Recipe App is a web application developed using Python and the Django framework. It aims to provide users with a platform to discover, create, and share their favorite recipes.

## Features
- **Recipes Module:** The core functionality of the application revolves around managing recipes. Users can create, edit, and delete recipes, as well as view details such as ingredients, cooking times, and difficulty.
- **Tests:** Modules are created and then the tests are created for the matching modules to continiously check for module error.

## Future Development
- **Templates:** The next phase of development will focus on creating visually appealing and responsive templates for the Recipe App. These templates will enhance the user interface, making it more engaging and accessible.
- **Views:** Alongside template development, views will be implemented to handle user requests and render appropriate responses. This includes rendering recipe details, listing recipes, and managing user interactions.
